Instructions on how to run code for tasks 1,2 and 4. To execute code related to task 3, please refer to the readme in the `task3/` directory

Before running the code, please ensure that you placed the `timetable_changes` and `timetables` folders from the dataset in the `data/` directory. Otherwise the code won't work as expected.

In the project root directory run:

1. `docker compose build`

2. `docker compose up -d`

3. `chmod +x run_all_tasks.sh`

4. `./run_all_tasks.sh`

To remove all containers created via docker compose run `docker compose down`
